Here you are again with one of your numerous side jobs. Today you’re working for “CatTrash FishTeck!” The cheapest and most poorly branded thrift techstore in town. 
Of course, the job you’ve been hired to do has nothing to do with tech, and everything to do hopping around in a beady eyed khoi-catfish hybrid mascot costume.
It smells HORRIBLE. Like a rat crawled in the suit and died.
You really wonder how you’ve come this far as a college student only to be resigned once again to this prison of polyester.  
You: This might kill me. Thank god no one will know it's me in there. 
You take a deep breath, and you try to figure out which of the twenty zippers you should open to actually get inside the dang thing.
You: God, how am I even going to convince people to come into the shop dressed like this.
