  - You lean in to sniff the flowers. They smell sweet.
  - Mm, yeah, these are nice!
  - When you pull back, you see a bee standing on the flower. You gently offer it
    a ride on your finger.
  - It accepts and you show it to Noki. She smiles and waves at it. The bee waves
    back.

  - You lean in to sniff the flowers, but sniff too hard.
  - Pollen blocks your nose and you sneeze violently, causing petals to fly everywhere.
  - A bee rises angrily from the flower and you swear it raises its fist at the both
    of you as it flies away.
  - Well, I suppose not if your recipient has allergies.
