You begin to spin the ‘Shop here’ sign that contains the picture of the store’s mascot with a thumbs up and a huge grin.

The sign spins majestically in the air as you break out some of the craziest dance moves anyone has ever seen a mascot perform. They start filming! A dance circle forms. 
Suddenly a mysterious, second mascot emerges from the crowd! The break out a boombox and challenge you to a duel!
You show them no mercy. They are no match. A perfect Victory. 
You will be preserved in the recommended videos tab of strangers for eternity. 
You bring in a lot of business. After a few hours, you get your paycheck and the manager can’t keep a smile off your face. 
Then you notice the photos on her wall. Breakdancing competitions. Could it be? The mysterious challenger? She smiles and thanks you. You see a tear fall from her eye. Looks like you’ll get some good recommendations.
