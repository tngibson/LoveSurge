You grab some flyers and start to walk around the strip mall. You begin to hand out flyers, but people try to walk past you. 
YOU. DON’T. LET. THEM.
You turn around and start running after the people who walk past you, holding the flyers out.
You: JUST TAKE IT. SUPPORT LOCAL FISHNISESS. 
You: PLEASE, SIR! JUST A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME!
The people you are chasing after start running and screaming, but they never escape.
By the end of the day, no fliers remain. 
In your hands at least, there are plenty in the trash and scattered through the streets. You let out a sigh of pride as you return to the store.
The manager can barely look you in the eyes. She’s been watching the cameras. 
When she hands you your check she holds on a little longer than she should…like she feels physical pain in having to actually give it to you.
Looks like you’re probably not going to work for this store again.
