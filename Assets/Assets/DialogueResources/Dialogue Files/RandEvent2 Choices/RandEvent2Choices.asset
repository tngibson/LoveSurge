  - Pop some headphones in. Commit all the way. Do a silly little fishy dance.

    - "You begin to spin the \u2018Shop here\u2019 sign that contains the picture
      of the store\u2019s mascot with a thumbs up and a huge grin."
    - Some people that were walking around the strip mall decided to stop in their
      tracks, and watch you throw the sign in the air.
    - The sign spins majestically in the air as you break out some of the craziest
      dance moves anyone has ever seen a mascot perform. They start filming! A dance
      circle forms.
    - Suddenly, a mysterious second mascot emerges from the crowd! They break out
      a boombox and challenge you to a duel!
    - You show them no mercy. They are no match. A perfect Victory.
    - You will be preserved in the recommended videos tab of strangers for eternity.
    - "You bring in a lot of business. After a few hours, you get your paycheck and
      the manager can\u2019t keep a smile off her face."
    - "Then you notice the photos on her wall. Breakdancing competitions. Could it
      be? The mysterious challenger? She smiles and thanks you. You see a tear fall
      from her eye. Looks like you\u2019ll get some good recommendations."

    - You grab some flyers and start to walk around the strip mall. You begin to
      hand out flyers, but people try to walk past you.
    - "YOU. DON\u2019T. LET. THEM."
    - You turn around and start running after the people who walk past you, holding
      the flyers out.
    - JUST TAKE IT. SUPPORT LOCAL FISHNISESS.
    - PLEASE, SIR! JUST A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME!
    - The people you are chasing after start running and screaming, but they never
      escape.
    - By the end of the day, no fliers remain.
    - In your hands at least, there are plenty in the trash and scattered through
      the streets. You let out a sigh of pride as you return to the store.
    - "The manager can barely look you in the eyes. She\u2019s been watching the
      cameras."
    - "When she hands you your check she holds on a little longer than she should\u2026like
      she feels physical pain in having to actually give it to you."
    - "Looks like you\u2019re probably not going to work for this store again."
