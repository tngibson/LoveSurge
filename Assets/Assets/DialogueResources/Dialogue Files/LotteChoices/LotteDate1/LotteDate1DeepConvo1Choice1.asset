    - Both of you wipe a tear from your cheek as the ending faded and you are left
      with that scene burning in your memory.
    - "Wow\u2026 that was a roller coaster of emotions. What did you think of it?
      I really enjoyed it."
    - It. was. Awesome! I think that was the best thing I've ever seen! The fighting,
      the costumes, the story, the emotional impact! I could go on for hours!
    - "I feel a similar way, I can absolutely understand why it\u2019s such a classic.
      The story was so intense where they wanted you to really feel it but never
      felt overbearing. "
    - "Mmm\u2026and I honestly admire all of the magical girls. I think I resonate
      with Natsume the best."
    - Lotte stands up from her seat and makes a heroic pose.
    - "Her pose mimics Natsume\u2019s pose in one of her bravest moments as she recites
      her lines."
    - You cover your mouth with your hand as you try not to snicker.
    - "You don\u2019t get to determine who I am! Only I am capable of doing so with
      the magic of friendship!"
    - Lotte proceeds to make a bunch of sounds imitating light beams and sparkles.
    - You break into laughter and smile as she reenacts scenes she liked.
    - "Thanks for letting me come along, I think\u2026I found my new favorite thing.
      Natsume is\u2026who I strive to be."
    - You think I can be like her, right?
    - Lotte looks into your eyes as she holds onto your hands.

    - As you both watch you turn to Lotte seeing her enchanted by what's going on
      on screen.
    - How are you enjoying the show?
    - I like it a lot. They all know their callings. They all get to be super cool   
      while saving the world and people they love.
    - They all have cool and unique personalities.
    - The characters are awesome, they have like, the coolest job.
    - They have people to lean on, people who always have their back, and vice versa.
      They are confident and powerful! Always able to defeat the bad guys.
    - "A faint melancholic expression spreads across Lotte\u2019s face."
    - 'I wish I could be with them, have wonderful powers, fight bad guys and make
      the world a better place, to have a purpose aside from what you are. '
    - I aspire to be like them.
    - You look at her and hear the sorrow in her voice and offer her a warm smile.
    - "I say go for it, there isn\u2019t anything stopping you from being like those
      you look up to."
    - You can be your own magical girl. You could even make your own character.
    - "Lotte\u2019s eyes widen when she hears those words, her hands gently clenching
      together as she holds them to her chest."
    - "When we get back, I can even help you make one. Speaking of that...it\u2019s
      getting a bit late, we stayed far later than I anticipated."
