      that I've really enjoyed."

      each other. I prefer happier endings but sometimes a tear-jerking series hits
      the right spot."
    - "Seeing people just fit together and go through highs and lows, and making
      it through the hard times gives me chills. It reminds me that\u2026love still
      exists and isn\u2019t completely dead. "
    - "They are a little different from shows like \u201CThe Seafarer Lunar\u201D
      but I think you might like them."

      to have their back. They were stronger together rather than alone\u2026"

      and trust in each other makes them stronger by knowing they don\u2019t have
      to do it alone\u2026where others have their back."
