  - "Lotte, I know you keep saying you\u2019re fine\u2026 but you don\u2019t seem
    fine. You don\u2019t have to keep pretending with me."
  - "Pretending\u2026 huh."
  - Lotte pauses for a moment, then laughs shakily.
  - "You really don\u2019t pull punches, do you?"
  - She exhales, finally looking up at you.
  - "Okay, maybe I\u2019ve been\u2026 off lately. Just... stuff piling up. But it\u2019s
    kind of nice that you noticed."
  - You both sit there, quiet, but the silence finally feels safe.
  - "You don\u2019t have to tell me everything. I\u2019ll just be here, alright?"
  - "Heh\u2026 you\u2019re way too nice sometimes, you know that?"

    I mean, it\u2019s late anyway."
  - "Oh. Right\u2026 yeah. Guess it is."
  - "You laugh weakly, trying to fill the space that\u2019s now gone quiet."
  - "Heh, besides, we\u2019ve had enough serious stuff lately, right?"
  - Lotte looks down again.
  - "Yeah. Guess that\u2019s easier."
  - "You can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s agreeing\u2026 or giving up."
  - "The silence stretches on. You were so close, but you couldn\u2019t bring yourself
    to cross that line."
