    - You smile softly and lean down, putting your hand on her shoulder, rubbing
      it gently for comfort.
    - "It can be hard, not knowing yourself\u2026"
    - We all have to navigate the stress and anxiety that comes with finding yourself,
      your style, and who you are as a person.
    - Lotte looks you in the eyes, sniffling as she listens to you.
    - You continue as you pull your hand away and continue to smile at her.
    - "You have been through so much\u2026and it\u2019s never easy. If you asked
      me\u2026you have been so strong."
    - "You had an idea of what you wanted to be, but didn\u2019t know how to get
      there."
    - "There isn\u2019t anything wrong with that."
    - Even if you went a little off the deep end, you came back.
    - You realized it was a bandage for a much larger issue. That's already better
      than what so many people have done.
    - She takes a deep breath and looks over to you with a weak smile, letting out
      a soft laugh.
    - "I guess I\u2019m pretty behind, and I don\u2019t really know how to be a person,
      huh\u2026"
    - Your face scrunches up in a small laugh as you smile and feel relief as Lotte
      slowly feels like she's coming back to her usual self, but just a bit more
      confident.
    - "I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think you are doing half bad, you\u2019ve
      barely started."
    - "If your life was a show...we wouldn\u2019t have even finished the first season
      yet."
    - You and Lotte laugh together for a moment before you pull her into a hug.
    - Whatever hardships you go through, I'm right here, let me help you, okay?

    - You offer a warm smile and lean down in front of Lotte, gently cupping her
      lower cheek, softly swiping away a tear with your thumb.
    - You gently tilt her head to look at you, giving her a relieved and reassuring
      smile.
    - "Listen, it can be hard not knowing your true self\u2026but I want you to know
      that you can also lean on me."
    - "You\u2019ve been through so much and\u2026you\u2019re already acknowledging
      those mistakes. That\u2019s what makes you human."
    - "You are so much stronger than you think. You just have to fight\u2026fight
      for yourself."
    - Lotte leans forward, falling into you and closing her eyes. She takes deep
      breaths, calming herself down by matching your rhythm.
    - You take a moment to comfort her further, wrapping your arms around her and
      gently rubbing her back.
    - "Thank you [PlayerName]\u2026and for understanding."
    - "While I don\u2019t want to let things go, I know I don\u2019t have to go back."
    - "Even if things went further than I ever had thought\u2026I know now that I
      am more than just a coffee maker\u2026"
    - "Maybe I can go back to making art with coffee, but also take some time to
      do other things I enjoy, so I don\u2019t burn myself out."
    - "You can, but\u2026don\u2019t forget you\u2019re not just a coffeemaker. You\u2019re
      Lotte as well. The best magical girl in my heart\u2026and besides\u2026"
    - You gently grab her hand and place it over your chest.
    - "I am your personal sidekick that you can lean on\u2026just know that I am
      here for always, as I have said before, okay?"
    - 'Lotte lets out a soft laugh and wipes her tears away, running down her cheek. '
    - An adorable one at that, too.
