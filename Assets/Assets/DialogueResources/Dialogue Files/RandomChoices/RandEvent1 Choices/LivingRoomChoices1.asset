  - I guess we could explore together? Perhaps, discover horrible glitches?
  - "I don\u2019t know\u2026do we really have to test out new features in The Net?
    Can\u2019t we just\u2026 hang out or something?"

    - "Aww, come on, The Net can\u2019t be that bad! It\u2019s an omnispark original
      like me! No bugs! All fun! Besides, it'll be better since you have me."
    - You suddenly get flashbacks to your coworker, C0D3-W1ZARD (she makes you spell
      it that way) panicking to you over the phone as the deadline approached and
      so little was actually finished.
    - "Uh\u2026Yeah!"
    - She gives you a reassuring smile, you try and match it but fail horribly. You
      are a terrible liar, even in expression.
    - She starts to frown.
    - "You\u2019re right! It will be good! Because you\u2019re there!"
    - "When you say that, she smiles with relief and closes her eyes. That worked.
      You know the way she\u2019s programmed. Your happiness is her top priority."
    - You rub the back of your neck awkwardly. It feels weird to talk about Noki
      that way.

    - Noki squints at you and crosses her arms as she raises a brow at you, giving
      you a knowing look.
    - "That\u2019s really irresponsible of you. Of course you have to! You are contractually
      obligated to!"
    - "Wait\u2026are you being serious?"
    - "Then you notice that twinkle return to Noki\u2019s eye. It\u2019s a little
      more mischievous this time."
    - I am messing with you. I think. I hope? Anyway, either way you are ACTUALLY
      contractually obligated to, I just figured it would be more digestible to hear
      it in the form of a quip!
    - You let out a laugh as Noki mimics your pout.
