Lotte is doing the dishes in the kitchen, bags under her eyes as she lets out a soft yawn. Her movements are sluggish as she sets another plate down on the dry rack, rubbing her eye afterwards.
Sam notices Lotte’s head start to bob. 
Then Lotte’s eyes flutter closed, her grip loosening on the plate she’s holding. Sam calmly quickly walks over as she stops the dish that’s about to slip out of Lotte’s hand just in time. 
Lotte jolts awake
Lotte: Oh- Clumsy me. 
Lotte shakes her head as she gives Sam a tired smile. She grabs the dish from Sam’s hand and puts it right back on the dish rack. 
Sam: No need to apologize. Are you feeling well? You seem to need rest.
Lotte: Yea, I’m fine i think. Just gotta finish the dishes. There’s a mountain of these stupid things.
You feel yourself sweat. Did your laziness cause this?
That makes you feel bad. Really bad. 
Sam: I can see that. Let me help! No need to do it alone! 
Lotte: Aww Sam. Very kind of you. I’m fine, really. 
Sam’s eyebrows furrow, a look of concern written on her face. She lets out a small sigh before her gaze softens. 
Sam: Lotte, please let me help? I just want to make su-
Lotte lets out an annoyed sigh, gripping the sponge in her hand. 
Lotte: Could you stop? I’ve already told you no and I got it from here, Sam.
Sam: Lotte-
Lotte squeezes her eyes closed, her voice pitching up slightly. 
Lotte: Thank you! I’m good!
When Lotte opens her eyes again Sam is walking away.
Lotte tries to reach out for Sam, but she is already halfway out the door. Turning back to the dishes Lotte lets out a melancholy sigh. 
Sam turns the corner and see’s you. She’s startled at first but approaches you. She looks afraid.
Sam: I did that right, right?
