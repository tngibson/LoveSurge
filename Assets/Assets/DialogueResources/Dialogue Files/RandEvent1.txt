You get up with a yawn.  Immediately you pull out your SPARKVISION™  glasses and enter the net.
Sam, your phone, stands in front of you with a calm smile on her lips. She waves at you before she begins to speak. 
Sam: Hello! Good morning! I hope our adventures in the world will prove worthwhile today!
You: Mmm, ye. Blelhhhhhhh. Sorry give me a minute. Hope that isn’t boring
Sam: Doing my job is never boring!
Sam nods before she grins, her eyes twinkling a little bit. It makes you feel a little better about your day. You wake up and brush your teeth. Sam meets you in the kitchen. 
Sam: Now to business! Seeing as your schedule is clear for the next….oh…for a while. Um. It seems you’ll have plenty of time to do your testing duties with me! 
You cross your arms, letting out a drawn out sigh. Man, you have been wanting to spend time with Sam but you're still exhausted from orientation.
You: Riiight. A nap sounds better. Can I fit that into my schedule?
Sam: Nope! Me time! So, what did you want to do on our test?
