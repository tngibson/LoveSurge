      you\u2019re used to."
    - Yeah. Was just stepping outside for a minute.
    - Where do you go when you do that?
    - During those first few weeks I found out the range for your apartment technically
      goes to your roof.
    - I go there sometimes.
    - "That\u2019s chill."
    - Is that supposed to be a pun?
    - No.
    - Oh. Well it was kind of funny anyway.

    - The dripping seems to be coming from a window sill. The window that leads to
      the fire escape. There seems to be a small trail of ice leading up the fire

    - Putting on your OMNIVISION glasses on the roof you see Celci, sitting passively
      on the ledge. Their hair blows softly in the howling wind.

      so perfect you\u2019d barely notice that you\u2019re outside if it wasn\u2019t
