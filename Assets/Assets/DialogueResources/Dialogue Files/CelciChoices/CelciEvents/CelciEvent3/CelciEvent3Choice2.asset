    - "Climbing up a fire escape isn\u2019t exactly the quietest thing in the world."
    - That makes sense, I guess.
    - Are you okay?
    - "Why\u2019d you come out here?"
    - "It\u2019s easy to ground myself when I\u2019m away from everything. This is
      as close as you can get I\u2019ve found."
    - "\u2026"
    - Would you sit with me?
    - Yeah.
    - When you sit next to Celci you can see that their hands are trembling slightly
      and their eyes are red from crying.
    - You both sit quietly on the roof and watch cars drive by on the road below.
      Birds sing soft songs and the rustling of trees in the summer wind fills your
      ears like white noise. Celci kicks their feet.
    - "It\u2019s nice up here right?"
    - Yeah.
    - An hour passes.
    - "\u2026thanks for sitting up here with me."
    - Of course. It was nice.
    - Celci stands up and offers you a hand. You try to take it but end up phasing
      right through them. You fall back and knock your head on the roof.
    - Pfft. Nerd.
    - Celci walks away.
