  - You toss a folder at Celci shuriken style!
  - '*BONK*'
  - "Nice it hit dead on! Hang on a second that\u2019s probably not a goo-"
  - GAH! What's your issue!
  - Celci throws the file in their hand back at you. Expertly you dodge the folder
    while picking up another one. You toss it at Celci!
  - "Okay. I\u2019ll admit."
  - That was moderately impressi-HYAH!
  - Celci dodges under the folder and throws another one at you, it flies past your
    head and shatters on the wall.
  - What? What was even in that one?
  - "Hahah! I don\u2019t care! Take this! Take that!"
  - Celci tosses more folders at you, each smacking against your face, with varying
    sounds echoing out of the folders.
  - GAHAHAHAH! You should see your face! One of them exploded with pie cream!
  - You wipe away the gross gooey meringue cream away from your face.
  - "The cold dead silence is now completely gone, instead replaced with Celci and
    Your laughter\u2026"
  - With renewed power, you both go back to digging in the folders.

  - "You toss a folder at Celci and it pathetically flops to the ground\u2026"
  - What was that supposed to be? Are you saying you found it?
  - Celci reaches for the folder labeled P:/user/wawawawa/funnysounds.mp3. The folder
    flops open and out from the folder echoes a loud fart sound effect.
  - What in the world?
  - "How? What? Why? I\u2026 can\u2019t even begin to figure out what is going on
    in this lab."
  - Stop wasting time.
  - "At least the silence is gone, but you\u2019re certainly left more confused than
    anything\u2026"
