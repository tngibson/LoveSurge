  - "Celci\u2026 Do you hear that?"
  - "You talked about cicadas a while ago\u2026 so I assume they\u2019re those."
  - "I\u2019m flattered you remembered that but those probably aren\u2019t actually
    cicadas."
  - The ones that screech in the night are usually katydids.
  - "They don\u2019t share a lot of similarities with cicadas\u2026 just the sound
    really."
  - "Huh? What! I\u2019ve been telling people those are cicadas!"
  - pftt sorry! I should have been more specific!
  - So why are you bringing it up now?
  - "Well katydids don\u2019t burrow at all, and they don\u2019t really need to stay
    as nymphs that long either, they just molt enough until they can leave."
  - "Huh\u2026"
  - Celci stops for a moment and lets out a deep breath.
  - "They continue walking again, but it seems like they\u2019re standing a little
    bit taller. Maybe something resonated with them?"
  - So I guess they decide when the time is right?
  - "I guess that\u2019s one way to put it\u2026 cicadas stay in the ground until
    they\u2019re ready, katydids take up any chance they get."
  - "You and Celci walk in the woods for a while, Celci seemingly digesting the information
    you\u2019ve shattered their worldview with. As the cries die down, Celci chimes
    up again."
  - "I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m thanking you but\u2026 thanks\u2026 I guess the
    bug talk has\u2026 helped a little."
  - Celci chuckles, and you both proceed forward into the ever darkening night.

  - "You talked about cicadas a while ago\u2026 so I assume they\u2019re those."
  - So you actually remembered something I said?
  - "Don\u2019t get an inflated ego\u2026 but yes. I did."
  - Why did cicadas catch your interest?
  - "Well\u2026 It was interesting that they were buried for a long time\u2026"
  - "I suppose they only really emerge once they\u2019re finished molting huh\u2026"
  - Celci seemingly sinks even more into themselves because of that phrase. Did something
    hit home?
  - I guess they understand that things would only get screwed up if they emerged
    early?
  - I guess so?
  - "The screeching of the \u2018cicadas\u2019 gets louder as you both sneak through
    the night. Celci is clearly not doing any better after your bug talk\u2026"
  - Celci? Do you wanna talk?
  - ...
  - "I\u2019ll take that as a no\u2026"
