  - You pull over a chair to use as leverage. Your fingertips just reach the edge
    of the packaging, pulling it down to reveal a sweet bun in a plastic wrap.
  - Ooh, I was getting a little hungry.
  - They snatch it out of your hand.

  failureDialogLines:
  - You jump up to grab the package midair. As you feel the plastic beneath your
    fingers, you snatch it!
  - However, as you come down, so does the entire pile of paper.
  - Celci comes over to see you on the ground beneath scattered documents before
    their eyes lock onto the small plastic package in your hand.
  - Oh, a sweet bun. Thanks.
  - They grab it, open it, and leave you to your anguish as they eat it.
