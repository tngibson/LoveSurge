  - You approach the butterfly with excruciating slowness.
  - It flutters its wings just as you swing down and catch it. Celci gasps and runs
    over to you.
  - "I can\u2019t believe you actually caught it!"
  - They look at it with absolute awe.

  - After a short moment of calculation, you make your move!
  - You jump forward and fling your net over the butterfly!
  - As you raise your head to look, however, you see your net full of leaves and
    the butterfly floating gracefully away.
  - Well, you tried I guess.
