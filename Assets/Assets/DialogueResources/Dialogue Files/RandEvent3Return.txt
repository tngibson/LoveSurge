You return your gaze to the kitchen. You wonder if you should go talk to her, but maybe you should leave her be. You could see that Lotte has a look of regret on her face, and you walk over to her. 
You: Hey, just know that you can lean on us, alright? That’s all I’ll say as I don’t want to push you more. 
You give her a soft smile as you stand back a bit, giving her space. Lotte glances over her shoulder, a soft smile forms on her lips.
Lotte: Thank you..
