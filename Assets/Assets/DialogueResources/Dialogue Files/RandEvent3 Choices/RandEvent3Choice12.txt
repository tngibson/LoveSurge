Sam: Oh, did I disappoint you?
Sam’s eyes glaze over. 
You: No, no! You didn’t disappoint me. It’s just some people don’t want to ask for help and pushing them when they’ve declined tends not to end well. 
Sam nods before she looks down at the ground. She walks away, not meeting your eyes again. You try to call out to her.
You: Hey, don’t be hard on yourself. You were being a good friend by trying to look out for Lotte. 
She’s already gone.
