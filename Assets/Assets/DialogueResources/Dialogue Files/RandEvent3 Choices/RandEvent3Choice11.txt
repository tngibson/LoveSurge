Sam: Thank you.
She pauses. Thinking over her next words carefully.
Sam: All I wanted to do was to help. 
You: You did your best, besides maybe all she needs is some time.
Sam: You’re right, I’m glad you’re at least happy with my actions. 
Sam takes a moment, and recollects herself, resuming her usual smile. She walks back to your room.
