    - "You have a cheeky grin on your face as you act like you\u2019re pulling something
      from your sleeve but pull it from behind you."
    - You give Noki a white rose, placing it right above her right ear.
    - "Hey Noki\u2026can you tell me what white roses mean?"
    - "Noki\u2019s eyes widen in surprise. Her cheeks begin to burn up as she looks
      into your eyes."
    - "I-..uhm\u2026why yes. According to my..search..it can mean new beginnings,
      everlasting love, or admiration. What are you..trying to go for?"
    - You lean a little closer, and cup her right cheek as you begin to speak.
    - What would you say if I said all three?
    - "Noki\u2019s cheeks turn even more red, letting out a huff."
    - "Quit teasing me, [PlayerName]. You\u2019re being cruel-."
    - She gets cut off as you give her a soft kiss. You then pull away, just to see
      her melting a bit.
    - "You\u2019re adorable when you\u2019re flustered. Come on..let\u2019s get going."
    - Noki looks a bit surprised and even more flustered than before, grumbling a
      bit. However, after a few seconds she smiles.

    - "You lean forward and wrap your arms around her torso. She\u2019s a bit startled,
      but she relaxes."
    - She has a small smile, wrapping her arms around you in return.
    - "I care for you as one my dear friends and just know as I said before I will
      always be here. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re the perfect Noki or not."
    - "I\u2026thank you, [PlayerName]. I will always be here for you as well. Thank
      you for accepting me."
    - She buries her face into your shoulder a bit. You two sit there in silence
      as you hug for quite a while.
    - Once she pulls away, you let go of her. You give her a reassuring smile as
      you look out at the flowers.
    - "I think we should get back home. It\u2019s getting a bit late."
    - Yea..thanks for doing this with me. Also..if I may ask, did you ever find the
      right flowers?
    - No, but I think it was the perfect excuse to hang out with you.
    - She smiles a little more, feeling pretty giddy from hearing that.
