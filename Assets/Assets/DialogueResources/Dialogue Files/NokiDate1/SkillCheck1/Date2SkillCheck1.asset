  - "Your foot catches a solid piece of the soil just before you dive headfirst into
    the plants, unfortunately it's not quite enough to keep you on your feet\u2026"
  - Ah! [Player Name]!
  - Luckily for you, the few extra seconds granted Noki just enough time to catch
    your flailing body before you plummeted to your assured doom. Noki helps you
    backup the bank of the riverside.
  - "Thanks so much Noki, I would have been\u2026 not quite fish food I don\u2019t
    think\u2026 um\u2026 plant fertilizer?"
  - "Of course, [Player Name]. It\u2019s my duty to\u2026 *huff huff* assist you
    if at all possible. I concluded that would\u2026 *huff huff* include physically
    saving you, and for your information, *huff huff* those plants wouldn\u2019t
    have eaten you."
  - "Haha of course\u2026 um, Noki, you look more worn out than me!"
  - "I wasn\u2019t made for\u2026 *huff huff* physically strenuous tasks\u2026 I
    am a phone after all\u2026"
  - You stand back up and help Noki to her feet, and you both carefully navigate
    as far as you can away from the river.

  - You flaily wildly and try to regain your balance by any means necessary. Your
    foot catches the ground, but not before the muddy soil slips out from under you,
    causing you to fall directly into the flowers.
  - A mixed with the increasing discomfort of various twigs and foliage digging into
    your skin. Just before you make your peace with this dramatic ending Noki rips
    you up from your flowery demise.
  - '[Player Name] are you ok! You fell pretty hard into those bushes!'
  - Noki gently brushes off some of the flowers still stuck to your clothes.
  - I-I-I I thought I was going to die!
  - "[Player Name],  let\u2019s get you away from this river."
