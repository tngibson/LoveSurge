Sam: Aww, come on, The Net can’t be that bad! It’s an omnispark original like me! No bugs! All fun! Besides, it'll be better since you have me. 
You suddenly get flashbacks to your coworker, C0D3-W1ZARD (she makes you spell it that way) panicking to you over the phone as the deadline approached and so little was actually finished. 
You: Uh…Yeah!…
She gives you a reassuring smile, you try and match it but fail horribly. You are a terrible liar, even in expression. 
She must have been hoping that would make you feel a little better. She starts to frown
You: You’re right! It will be good! Because you’re there!
When you say that she smiles with relief and closes her eyes. That worked. You know the way she’s programmed. Your happiness is her top priority.
You rub the back of your neck awkwardly. It feels weird to talk about Sam that way.
