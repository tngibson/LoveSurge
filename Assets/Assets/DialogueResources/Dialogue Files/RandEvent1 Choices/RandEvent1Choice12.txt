Sam squints at you and crosses her arms as she raises a brow at you, giving you a knowing look. 
Sam: That’s really irresponsible of you. Of course you have to! You are contractually obligated to!
You frown.
You: Wait, are you being serious? 
Then you notice that twinkle return to Sam’s eye. It’s a little more mischievous this time. 
Sam: I am messing with you. I think. I hope? Anyway, either way you are ACTUALLY contractually obligated too, I just figured it would be more digestible to hear it in the form of a quip!
You let out a laugh as Sam mimics your pout.
